# TODOs

## Compiler
- urgent:
    - inv_table
- low priority:
    - zeros_like (a bit shorter)
    - import numpy as np (parse from source?)
    - revert back to np.dot (can also handle scalars)
- outlook: secondary pass over AST 
    - dead code elimination
    - common subexpression elimination 

## Tests
- all models from Barthels et al.
- benchmarks for varying matrix sizes 
    - at least one case with inverses
    - forward vs. transformed

## Publication:
- GitHub
- PyPI (pip)
